# CHATBOT
A python based chatbot that learns inputs from the user using a JSON knowledge base.
Used as an employee assistant chatbot which can record leave applications and employee complaints

The knowledge base stores the data that it has learned from the user. If it doesn't have a close match to the question asked by the user, it will ask you to teach the model the output.
After inputting leave application or complaint registration, a file is created where the data is stored.
